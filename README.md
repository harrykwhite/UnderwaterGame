*Underwater Game* was a discontinued game project originally intended to be the second major project (after *MANIC*) by Geta Games Team, an online game development team I ran in my free time between 2015 and 2021. The project entered development towards the end of 2019 and was cancelled in early 2021 largely due to poor design direction on my part. All of this game's code was written by me, though in retrospect I wish I had put more effort into finding other people to actively contribute to the coding, so more of my attention could have been put towards design.

This game was written in C# using the XNA / MonoGame Framework, which I was inspired to use after seeing games like *Terraria*, *Celeste*, *Stardew Valley*, etc. all making good use of it. I still think MonoGame is a great framework and have enormous respect for the people working on it; the only reason why I don't still use it today is because it uses C#, which is too abstract and high-level of a language for game development in my opinion.
